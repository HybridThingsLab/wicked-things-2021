### NodeMCU
You need to add the NodeMCU ESP8266 board to the Arduino's board library and do some minor configurations. It is well documented [here](https://www.instructables.com/Setting-Up-the-Arduino-IDE-to-Program-the-ESP8266-/). For NodeMCU boards we recommend to choose "NodeMUC 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)" in the Arduino IDE.
